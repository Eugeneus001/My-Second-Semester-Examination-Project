        <h2>Why <span class="highlight">MealTracker?</span></h2>
        <p>
          MealTracker is a smart nutrition assistant that analyzes your food purchases using AI, no manual input required. 
          By scanning receipts, restaurant orders, or digital transactions, it builds a personalized nutrition profile and 
          offers clear, data-driven suggestions to help you eat better. Think of it as a dietitian powered by machine learning, 
          working silently in the background.
